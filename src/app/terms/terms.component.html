    <br>
    <p class="text-secondary text-wrap " style="font-family:sans-serif; font-size: 14px; ">For details on our refund deadlines and policies, please refer to the information below; note that our policies differ for subscription payments vs. one-time course and Specialization purchases, and that payment options may vary from one Service to another. Please also note that we treat violations of our Terms of Use and Honor Code very seriously, and we have no obligation to offer refunds to learners who are found to be in violation of these terms, even if their requests are made within the designated refund period. Similarly, we have no obligation to offer late refunds to learners who do not pass a course or Specialization, or who are otherwise unsatisfied with their final grade.</p>

    <h3 class="text-dark" style="font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif">For Course and Specialization Purchases</h3>
    <p class="text-secondary text-wrap " style="font-family:sans-serif; font-size: 14px; ">If you cancel your paid enrollment for a course, ShareEd will offer you a complete refund until 14 days after payment, or until you have earned your Course Certificate, whichever is earlier. If you pre-enroll and pay for a course, ShareEd will offer you a complete refund until 14 days after the course launches or until you have earned your Course Certificate, whichever is earlier. For avoidance doubt, once you have earned a Course Certificate with your payment, you are not eligible for a refund even if it is within 14 days. If you do not earn your Course Certificate within 180 days, your registration will expire and you will need to pay to re-enroll for the course. However, if you’re taking a course through your company or organization (e.g. ShareEd for Business, Refugees or Government) then you can earn your certificate as long as your company's contract with ShareEd is active and your access has not expired in accordance with the terms of that contract. Similarly, refunds and cancellations will also be governed by the terms of that contract between your organization and ShareEd.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="text-secondary text-wrap " style="font-family:sans-serif; font-size: 14px; ">If you cancel your one-time, paid enrollment for a Specialization, ShareEd will offer you a complete refund until 14 days after payment, or until you earn a Course Certificate for any course in the Specialization, whichever is earlier. If you pre-enroll and pay for the Specialization, ShareEd will offer you a complete refund until 14 days after the first course in the Specialization launches or until you have earned your first Course Certificate for any course in the Specialization, whichever is earlier. If you earned your first Course Certificate for any course in the Specialization within 14 days, you are not eligible for a refund. Unless otherwise indicated as part of the sign-up process, you have one year after you purchase a Specialization to complete the Specialization.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="text-secondary text-wrap " style="font-family:sans-serif; font-size: 14px; ">Notwithstanding the foregoing, shorter refund periods may apply to specific courses and Specializations (e.g., for courses that are part of the UCI Professional Certificate in Applied Project Management, you will only be eligible for a full refund until seven days after your payment date). In these cases, the shorter period will be stated as part of the sign-up process for the course or Specialization.</p>
    <br>

    <h3 class="text-dark" style="font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif">For Other Paid Services</h3>
    <p class="text-secondary text-wrap " style="font-family:sans-serif; font-size: 14px; ">Except as described in this Refund Policy or as explicitly stated as part of the sign-up process for a Service, ShareEd has no obligation to provide refunds or vouchers for any other Services.

    <h3 class="text-dark" style="font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif">Third Party Marketplaces</h3>
    <p class="text-secondary text-wrap " style="font-family:sans-serif; font-size: 14px; ">Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you purchase or subscribe for a course or Specialization, or purchase any other paid Service, through a third party marketplace (e.g., in-app purchases through the Apple App Store or purchases made through certain alternative payment services), the refund policy applicable to that third party marketplace will apply, unless otherwise explicitly stated by ShareEd. Except as otherwise explicitly stated by ShareEd, the third party marketplace will be solely responsible for making refunds under its refund policy, and ShareEd will have no refund obligations. ShareEd disclaims any responsibility or liability related to any third party marketplace's refund policy or the third party's compliance or noncompliance with such policy.</p>
